# pg-tools

An overlay app with multiple somewhat useful tools for Project: Gorgon.
VIP and Chat logs enabled are both required for most features.

## Current features:

- Read only chat window with channel selection;
- Multiple window support;
- Stats: Xp earned since opening the app;
- Stats: Level ups since opening the app (It's a 'dumb' feature, a multi-level up is treated as a single level).

## Upcoming features:

- Some sort of notification when character name is mentioned;
- In-zone earned loot & reports;
- Loot objective tracking.
